# Private-key-finder-
This tool is for educational purposes only. using this you can search the private keys of etherium, polygon, and binance accounts and theoretically find ones with a possitive balance. Right now it only saves the private keys of ones with a balance. You can use a private key to gain access to a wallet through metamask or some other wallet tool. To get started first you need to install of the necessary libraries for python. run 

pip install -r requirements.txt

After that open the terminal and cd to the folder with 

cd path/to/your/folder

next what you run is this command

python lol.py

that will boot up the searcher and it will start discovering wallets. it saves ones into a fundedwallets.txt file that will be in the same folder as the system
