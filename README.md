# Private-key-finder-
This tool is for educational purposes only. using this you can search the private keys of etherium, polygon, and binance accounts and theoretically find ones with a possitive balance. Right now it only saves the private keys of ones with a balance. You can use a private key to gain access to a wallet through metamask or some other wallet tool. To get started first you need to install of the necessary libraries for python. run 

pip install -r requirements.txt

After that open the terminal and cd to the folder with 

cd path/to/your/folder

next what you run is this command

python lol.py

that will boot up the searcher and it will start discovering wallets. it will ask if you want to look for a specific wallet or just hit enter to search randomly. it saves funded wallets into a fundedwallets.txt file that will be in the same folder as the system
